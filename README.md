# config-server-artechecture-microservice

## Project description

I  tried to create a project best practice, for microservice that uses from the git repository for configuration, it is very simple project and it is just nessessory configuration.

##  Directory structure

-   `git`: The config of the microservice is here .
-   `limits-service`: Folder of the service 1 .
-   `spring-cloud-config-server`: Folder of the provider configuration.

## How to run :

Open every Folder with intelij IDEA sepratly, and let them to downlaod the dependencies with maven, ( if you can not download, use VPN ) now run the projects.

###  Prerequisites

-   intelij IDEA
-   java version 17



### final discuse
As I said befor it is just a practice and for the learning, so do not use this for real project, of course in future I will put some real project in, 
actully microservice are configuration and all the other code will be like the before.
thanks for support :))
